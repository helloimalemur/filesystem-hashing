    It is good practice to exclude tmp directories, mail spools, log directories, proc filesystems, user's home directories, web content directories, anything that changes regularly. It is also good practice to include all system binaries, libraries, include files, system source files. It will also be a good idea to include directories you don't often look in like /dev /usr/man/.*usr/. Of course you'll want to include as many files as practical, but think about what you include.
